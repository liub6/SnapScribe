# SnapScribe: Contributing to Digital Twins with the Snap of a Finger

## Introduction

Buildings are the world’s largest asset class, worth around 350 trillion euros. However, the location, condition, and specifics of equipment are often unknown. This makes maintenance and repair planning difficult. SnapScribe aims to automate the data collection process, making it faster and more accurate.

## The Challenge

Traditionally, equipment inventories involve taking pictures of devices and manually writing down information. This process is time-consuming and error-prone. SnapScribe simplifies this by using smartphones to capture images. The app automatically recognizes device details like names, models, and serial numbers, and transcribes voice notes. All data is synced to the cloud for easy access and use.

## Key Features

- AI-based text recognition from equipment images (model and serial numbers).
- Transcription of voice recordings into text.
- Easy mapping of equipment locations using a building model.
- Cloud-sync for secure, accessible data.

## Why It Matters

SnapScribe is user-friendly, even for non-experts, and helps streamline the equipment inventory process. Facility managers and maintenance teams can complete inventories much faster without the risk of missing crucial information.

## Technologies of SnapScribe

SnapScribe relies on AI and machine learning for image recognition and voice transcription. Built with Flutter, the app runs on both iOS and Android devices. It integrates with cloud storage for secure, easy access to data and uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) to create a digital twin of the building.

## Next Steps

SnapScribe is just the beginning of smarter equipment inventories. The future holds many possibilities:
- Improve recognition algorithms for a wider range of equipment.
- Integrate data with BIM systems for comprehensive digital twins.
- Track the condition of equipment over time for proactive maintenance.
- Enhance reporting tools to help facility managers make data-driven decisions.

## Why Choose SnapScribe?

SnapScribe is designed for non-experts, automating tasks to save time and reduce errors. It’s cloud-based, so your data is always accessible. SnapScribe helps you stay organized, make informed decisions, and improve building management efficiency.

SnapScribe is the future of equipment inventories: smarter, faster, and more efficient with just a snap of your finger!
